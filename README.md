## Description

Welcome to my Getlinked Hackathon 1.0 Project! I have successfully completed a multifaceted hackathon task, which includes the development of a landing page, a contact page, and a registration page. These pages are not just static, but they come alive with seamless API integration. 

I have leveraged the power of Vite with React for a lightning-fast development experience, and I've styled my project with the elegance and responsiveness of Tailwind CSS. 

To showcase my work, I've deployed this project on Vercel, so you can explore it in the demo section below 

This project represents my dedication to creating dynamic web solutions while harnessing the latest technologies. I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed building it!
